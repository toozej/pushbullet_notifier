# Pushbullet Notifier for Bash

`pb_notifier.sh` is a simple Bash script to send notifications via the [Pushbullet service](https://www.pushbullet.com/) to the Pushbullet account of your choosing.

`pb_notifier.sh` does not have client functionality so you cannot use it to view pushes, interact with chats, etc. For a more full-featured Bash client check out [Red5d's](https://github.com/Red5d) [pushbullet-bash](https://github.com/Red5d/pushbullet-bash).
